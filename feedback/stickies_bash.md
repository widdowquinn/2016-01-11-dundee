## Green

* useful, good assistance
* I enjoyed the level that this session was pitched at
* David Martin
* pace is good
* exercises after each session
* good examples, nice idea with the post-its
* the pace was appropriate. I like the exercises
* walking through each step followed by example exercises/problems is a good way to get the concepts across
* 1. good way of lecturing 2. informative
* very very patient with all of us; great instructor, great (and plenty of) helpers; covers Windows and Mac; learning lots! although will have to sit back and econtinue learning/settling down concepts
* it started with the assumption of complete ignorance
* very good pace
* course and online content is great!
* so many staff; hand-in-hand support
* good coverage of the shell so far; good pace
* very interesting; like idea of using data together with common examples
* what commands tell the shell to do was went through well
* it was very good to understand most of the tasks
* good grounding for what's to come; helpful helpers!


## Red

* `man` pages would be helpful
* it would be nice to have some take-away tasks
* time-keeping
* long time to start the course
* slow start
* set up for the course took a long time
* I still find that I am making a lot of grammatical errors which I find hard to spot
* need to give a little read[ing] material before the course
* nano
* hope to have more different complex home work after training (I mean have lots of template[s] to follow when I need it)
* need a bit more infor regarding pipes
* pace of the whole course could be a bit slow
* more time could be spent on the shell before moving on to version control
* not enough time! too many interesting things to learn
* all good so far
* can provide more example files to get better understanding
* probably better to tell folk when to just listen and when to follow, as one missed line leads to falling behind when sometimes following isn't necessary
* free coffee would have been ace!
