# stickies_git.md

## Green

* `git` from the terminal instead of GUI (e.g. from `GitHub`)
* the stickies are great
* good to work through examples
* good to learn something about version control; must be very useful in the future work
* the examples are very powerful!!
* `git` is funny and useful
* a lot of support available from helpers
* not easy for me to get every detail, but very useful to have an overall view of what I learned today
* very interesting; very useful
* after the training I have a better understanding of how to use command line and how to do version control
* `GitHub`; good practical exercises
* well explained
* very useful thanks :)
* Thank you! very useful and encouraging workshop to keep learning! lots of resources, very well organised! impressed, thankful! :)
* I learnt a lot
* Etherpad


## Red

* push and pull was a bit chaotic
* would have been good to learn opening `Notepad++` at the command-line
* not enough time to go through everything properly
* more fresh air time would be welcome; the course got a little long (more breaks or a little less theory?)
* the demonstrator should use the same operating system "PC" or "MAC"
* I think the amount of material needs more time to go through
* a bit slow
* too much time spent on `GitHub` collaborators
* no protocol in hand; once lost a step it's off-chain; can't hear clearly at the back
* we didn't finish this morning's session!!; a bit confusing; a bit too fast
* a little hard to follow when making changes for each other
* helpers need to stop talking while main speaker is speaking; pointers need to work on both screens
* no coffee and cookies provided
* too many content for `git`
* the cake is a LIE!!!
* nothing
