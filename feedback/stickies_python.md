## Green

* Good, thanks!
* The course nad tutorials are good for starters; it is easy to understand
* Very clear instructions; the online practise material is real helpful and much easier to follow than yesterday
* Good manual, could let everyone follow easily
* The helpers are [quite] patient and knowledgeable; many thanks to their help
* Nice progressive build up of detail using a single dataset
* It's really good to have the exercises; I'd suggest having more (homework, for example)
* The pace was good enough to reach practical applications
* Format of today's lectures with files and examples is easier to follow than yesterday
* Very good overview of basic concepts relevant to data analysisery useful and motivating to lean more (and more) `Python`! Thank you!
* mentioning the issue with multiple names for the same object in memory
* Very helpful thanks :)
* Well gone thorugh in piece by piece fashion

## Red

* the subplot part with `matplotlib`
* some minor details for plotting and other commands not discussed enough
* perhaps a bit slow on the basics
* would you possibly to provide cookies during breaks? :)
* nothing bad
* exhausting! a little stretching every now and then would be good :)
* nothing bad to say really; course could be longer
* need coffee
* the desks in the room are displayed really awkwardly and I think it was very counter-productive
* "loops" didn't seem to be explicitly-enough detailed for me; may be just me though!
* none really
* time not allotted for whole syllabus (nitpicking)
