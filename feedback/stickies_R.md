## Red

* pace too fast when lots to type
* no bad things, but have a Q: How to get clean data for your analysis at the beginning?
* this should be a 3- or more day course! it was either slow or rushed!
* could have done with another day to continue at a better pace
* needs an extra day for `R` (too fast, and lots of content)
* no bad things
* not much bad to say, just a bit rushed
* too much to go thorugh in the allotted time
* I found the `R` exercises very difficult
* Great workshop, only trying to find a flaw because we have to :) in the future maybe it will be best to add one more day or try to cover less. I found [it] difficult to keep up my attention for so long
